    <p>A plotter is a type of printer used to print vector graphics. We have made a smaller version which is able to print any graphic having size less than 120 * 240 mm. Two stepper motors have been used for movement. Both the axis have independent motion i.e the pen holder and the printing bed can be independently moved. </p>

    <p> A micro servo motor has been used for lifting the pen up and down. An arduino UNO has been used for the control of these motors.Currently we need to connect a laptop having processing 3 software to execute the g-code. On providing the g-code file, the software sends the instructions to arduino by serial communication and thus the required motion of the stepper motors and servo motor is obtained.</p>

    <p>A raspberry PI will be used to do the g-code processing which in turn will send the instructions to arduino. Moreover IOT will be included as well wherein the gcode file would be directly sent to the Raspberry PI through wifi and the plotter would start printing the file.
